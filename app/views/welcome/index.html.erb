      <h3>Message from the committee</h3>
Life as we know it, has many ups and downs. There are many times when we feel like “throwing in the towel” and just being 
complacent. Unfortunately, this also finds its way into our relationship with God. We tend to give up when things seem tough, 
or when we feel incapable of following through with what we have been called to do as Christians, mostly because of the
pressures of this world. 
The theme for this year’s youth camp is “Mission Possible…Walking in His steps”. This theme encompasses our mandate as Christians 
to be disciples and make disciples of many nations. (Matt 28v19). It draws attention to a common issue in our Christian 
lives- being “in-step” with Christ. (Ephesians 5v1:2). The aim of this year’s youth camp is to broadcast the great news that 
with God all things are possible!
As Christians, our main goals in life is to be Christ like. Ideally, we are to constantly walk in His steps- Jesus’ steps. 
We are to be true Disciples of Christ, learning His perfect ways and doing as he did! True, it may be difficult as He told His disciples or rather, it is difficult!! But you see… the beautiful thing about this journey is that…the Mission is Possible with Christ!
Glory be to God, who has given us the Bible as a manual to life and the Holy Spirit as our guide, as well as grace to equip us on this 
Mission! As we consciously make the great decision of knowing Christ and making Him known, we  need to have faith, hope and love. 
With this, we know that the Mission is definitely possible!

<p>      My perception of camp meetings in general was not the best due to past experiences from other camp settings. 
I was invited by a friend and decided to attend the 2017 Accra Ridge Youth Fellowship Camp because I was on leave. 
My perception about camp meetings changed from the first meeting. I had never seen a youth group that was so dedicated to prayer- 
this got me excited and I knew from that night that this gathering would be great. 
My prayer life was dying down and needed urgent resuscitation hence I had to find help, that's what drove me to the Camp.
The theme, “Yet not I” brought me to the understanding of denying myself and dying daily. 
The daily dawn prayers, fasting and bible studies gave some spice to my life and I have held on to this even till now. 

I'll entreat every Christian within the target group to make it a point to attend this year’s camp. You are in for a life changing
  experience.</p>

<p>     Last year's youth camp was an insightful and thought provoking camp which had a theme which everyone could relate on; 
  “Yet Not I”. It was a reminder that through the ups and downs, highs and lows, it's by the grace of God who makes us who we are.
On a personal note, camp was and has always been a time for reflection and pondering. Last year's youth camp was an avenue to figure
  out and seek out the next step after school and which other place than 5 days in isolation, sitting at the feet of the Lord seeking
  His face. From dawn chain prayers to detailed teaching sessions to power packed all nights. At the end of those 5 days, decisions 
  concerning work, school, walk with Christ and relationships were clearer.
Camp was a teaching moment to blend in each and every section of my life and not solely be fixated on one aspect. Life after camp 
  has not been rosy as we plan it to be during camp, cliché as it may seem it is the truth but that's where church and
  fellowshipping plays a vital role as it helps guide us onto the path we desire.
So this year's youth camp, I entreat everyone to make it to camp. Remove that perception that after camp things will go back to
  its former self. Yes, it may seem so at first but that's when the Holy Spirit plays a significant role, the Holy Spirit convicts you.
  Unconsciously, the former self is renewed and then one becomes a new creation. I pray and hope the turn out for this camp will be
  overwhelming, as we spend time in His presence. Hope to see you there!!</p>
